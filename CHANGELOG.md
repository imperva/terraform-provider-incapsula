## 2.0.0 (Unreleased)

As we near certification readiness, we've made lots of changes to the provider. Backwards incompatible changes have been made to the Incap Rule resources. Please review the documentation. Changes below:

* All acceptance and unit tests now pass. There was a race condition issue with dependencies - see this Hashicorp issues: https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23169 and https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23635
* Migrate `resource_incap_rule` to use APIv2. See updated documentation and example files for the latest resource spec.
* Add fixes for data center and data center server result codes (oscillation between strings and ints)
* Fix importing of various resources: data center, data center server, Incap Rule, etc.
* Fix ceriticate argument requirements (thanks @areifert)
* Added GitHub workflow integration for side builds prior to certification (thanks @pklime2)
* Upgrade to Terraform v0.12
* Migrate to standalone Terraform SDK
* Started to improve consistency of error log messages (Site IDs, Rule IDs, etc.)
