# incapsula_abp_websites

Provides an ABP (Advanced Bot Protection) website resource. Allows you to enable and configure ABP for given websites.

This represents the canonical configuration of the ABP website groups and websites, if there are existing website groups or website, or they have different settings those will be removed or changed and not added as additional items.

NOTE: Due to limitations in ABP, the API key/id used to deploy this resource must match the `account_id` used in the resource (API key/id for a parent account do not work). All Incapsula sites associated with the resource must also be defined in that account.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "incapsula_abp_websites" "abp_websites" {
    account_id = data.incapsula_account_data.account_data.current_account
    auto_publish = true
    website_group {
        name = "sites-1"
        website {
            site_id = incapsula_site.sites-1.id
            enable_mitigation = false
        }
    }
    website_group {
        name = "sites-2"
        website {
            site_id = incapsula_site.sites-2.id
            enable_mitigation = true
        }
    }
}


resource "incapsula_abp_websites" "abp_websites" {
    account_id = data.incapsula_account_data.account_data.current_account
    auto_publish = true
    website_group {
        name = "sites"
        website {
            site_id = incapsula_site.sites-1.id
            enable_mitigation = false
        }
        website {
            site_id = incapsula_site.sites-2.id
            enable_mitigation = true
        }
    }
    website_group {
        name = "sites" # Duplicate name
        name_id = "sites-2" # name_id can be used to disambiguate names in case of duplicates
        website {
            site_id = incapsula_site.sites-3.id
            enable_mitigation = true
        }
    }
}
```
