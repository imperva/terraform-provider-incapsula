# incapsula_siem_splunk_connection

Provides a customer Splunk connection configuration resource.

The follow-on action is to use the `incapsula_siem_log_configuration` resource to configure the connection.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "incapsula_siem_splunk_connection" "example_siem_splunk_connection"{
	account_id = "1234567"
	connection_name = "APB siem-logs Splunk connection"
  	host = "my.splunk.com"
  	port = 8080
  	token = "Sensitive data placeholder"
  	disable_cert_verification = false
}
```
> **NOTE:**
For security reasons, when a resource is exported, the `token` field will be replaced with the value `Sensitive data placeholder`.
The actual values are still used in the communication with the Splunk server.
Note - This resource cannot be updated unless you specify a real value for the `token` field instead of `Sensitive data placeholder`.
To clarify, none of the fields in exported resources can be updated unless a real `token` value is set.

Example of exported resource:

```hcl
resource "incapsula_siem_splunk_connection" "example_siem_splunk_connection"{
	account_id = "1234567"
	connection_name = "APB siem-logs Splunk connection"
  	host = "my.splunk.com"
  	port = 8080
  	token = "Sensitive data placeholder"
  	disable_cert_verification = false
}
```
