# incapsula_siem_connection

Provides a customer S3 connection configuration resource.

The follow-on action is to use the `incapsula_siem_log_configuration` resource, to configure the connection.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "incapsula_siem_connection" "example_siem_connection_s3_basic"{
	account_id = "1234567"
	connection_name = "APB siem-logs connection basic auth"
	storage_type = "CUSTOMER_S3"
  	access_key = "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE"
  	secret_key = "wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY"
  	path = "myBucket/siem/logs"
}

resource "incapsula_siem_connection" "example_siem_connection_s3_arn"{
	account_id = "1234567"
	connection_name = "ABP siem-logs connection arn auth"
	storage_type = "CUSTOMER_S3_ARN"
  	path = "myBucket/siem/logs"
}
```
> **NOTE:**
For security reasons, when a resource is exported, the `access_key` and `secret_key` fields will be replaced with the value `Sensitive data placeholder`.
The actual key values are still used in the communication with the s3 bucket.
Note - This resource cannot be updated unless you specify a real value for the `access_key` and `secret_key` fields instead of `Sensitive data placeholder`.
To clarify, none of the fields in exported resources can be updated unless real `access_key` and `secret_key` values are set.

Example of exported resource:

```hcl
resource "incapsula_siem_connection" "example_siem_connection_s3_basic"{
	account_id = "1234567"
	connection_name = "APB siem-logs connection basic auth"
	storage_type = "CUSTOMER_S3"
  	access_key = "Sensitive data placeholder"
  	secret_key = "Sensitive data placeholder"
  	path = "myBucket/siem/logs"
}
```
