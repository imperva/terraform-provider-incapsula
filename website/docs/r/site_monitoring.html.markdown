# incapsula_site_monitoring

Configure settings to determine when origin servers should be considered “up” or “down” (active or inactive) by the Imperva Load Balancer. 
Select which failure scenarios you want to produce alarm messages, and how to send them.

Note that destroy action doesn't do any change in Imperva system. To return to default values,
delete all resource fields but `site_id` and execute `terraform apply`

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage - Site Monitoring

```hcl
resource "incapsula_site_monitoring" "example_site_monitoring" {
    site_id                        = 1234
    failed_requests_percentage     = 30
    failed_requests_min_number     = 2
    failed_requests_duration       = 1
    failed_requests_duration_units = "MINUTES"
	
    http_request_timeout           = 50
    http_request_timeout_units     = "SECONDS"
    http_response_error            = "501-599"
	
	use_verification_for_down      = false
	monitoring_url                 = "/users"
	expected_received_string       = "some string"
	up_checks_interval             = 15
	up_checks_interval_units       = "SECONDS"
	up_check_retries               = 10
	
	alarm_on_stands_by_failover    = true
	alarm_on_dc_failover           = true
	alarm_on_server_failover       = true
	required_monitors              = "ALL"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `site_id` - (Required) Numeric identifier of the site to operate on.
* `failed_requests_percentage` - (Optional) The percentage of failed requests to the origin server. Default: 40
* `failed_requests_min_number` - (Optional) The minimum number of failed requests to be considered as failure. Default: 3
* `failed_requests_duration` - (Optional) The minimum duration of failures above the threshold to consider server as down. 20-180 SECONDS or 1-2 MINUTES. Default: 40.
* `failed_requests_duration_units` - (Optional) Time unit. Possible values: SECONDS, MINUTES. Default: SECONDS.
* `http_request_timeout` - (Optional) The maximum time to wait for an HTTP response. 1-200 SECONDS or 1-2 MINUTES. Default: 35
* `http_request_timeout_units` - (Optional) Time unit. Default: SECONDS.
* `http_response_error` - (Optional) The HTTP response error codes or patterns that will be counted as request failures. Default: "501-599".
* `use_verification_for_down` - (Optional) If Imperva determines that an origin server is down according to failed request criteria, it will initiate another request to verify that the origin server is down. Default: true
* `monitoring_url` - (Optional) The URL to use for monitoring your website. Default: "/"
* `expected_received_string` - (Optional) The expected string. If left empty, any response, except for the codes defined in the HTTP response error codes to be treated as Down parameter, will be considered successful. If the value is non-empty, then the defined value must appear within the response string for the response to be considered successful.
* `up_checks_interval` - (Optional) After an origin server was identified as down, Imperva will periodically test it to see whether it has recovered, according to the frequency defined in this parameter. 10-120 SECONDS or 1-2 MINUTES. Default: 20
* `up_checks_interval_units` - (Optional) Time unit. Default: SECONDS.
* `up_check_retries` - (Optional) Every time an origin server is tested to see whether it’s back up, the test will be retried this number of times. Default: 3
* `alarm_on_stands_by_failover` - (Optional) Indicates whether or not an email will be sent upon failover to a standby data center. Default: true
* `alarm_on_dc_failover`- (Optional) Indicates whether or not an email will be sent upon data center failover. Default: true
* `alarm_on_server_failover` - (Optional) Indicates whether or not an email will be sent upon server failover. Default: false
* `required_monitors` - (Optional) Monitors required to report server / data center as down. Default: "MOST"

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `id` - Unique identifier in the API for the Site Monitoring. The id is identical to Site id.

## Import

Site Monitoring configuration can be imported using the `id`, e.g.:

```
$ terraform import incapsula_site_monitoring.example_site_monitoring 1234
```
